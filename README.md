To make sure the code works, you need to have every file in this repositories.

For code, you need to put the text into "text_input.txt", and then run "code.py", the output binaries will be written in "binary_output.txt".

For decode, you need to put the binaries into "binary_output.txt" (should be already there), and then run "decode.py", the output text will be written in "text_output.txt"

The 'test.py' can be run to check if the input text and output text are the same.
